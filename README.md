# My Indie Life Blog

A retro, indie-style personal blog website built with plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Share your life stories in a nostalgic, early-2000s web aesthetic.

## Features
- Handwritten font and pastel backgrounds
- Sidebar navigation
- Homepage, About, and Blog pages
- Blog posts as separate HTML files

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
2. Add new blog posts by creating HTML files in the `posts` folder and linking them in `blog.html`.

## Customization
- Edit `assets/style.css` for colors, fonts, and layout tweaks.
- Replace placeholder text with your own stories and info.

This project is intentionally simple and old-fashioned for maximum indie vibes.
